ECO
===

Set in a science fiction universe, the player takes on the role of an unnamed individual who is assisted by an artificial intelligence known as ECO. The player is given "room" descriptions (a "room" can be any describable place, e.g. a grassy field, a long hallway, a quadrant in outer space) and can then interact within the current "room" by written or spoken commands. Time-dependent sequences and full-fledged sound create a modern experience for the player as they explore and reveal a plot-twisting story.
