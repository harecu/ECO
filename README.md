ECO
===

*Set in a science fiction universe, the player takes on the role of an unnamed individual who is assisted by an artificial intelligence known as ECO. The player is given "room" descriptions and can then interact within the current room by written or spoken commands. Time-dependent sequences and full-fledged sound create a modern experience for the player as they explore and reveal a plot-twisting story.*

The game will be broken into Chapters or Sections composed of "rooms" depending on how our development process goes. A "room" can be any describable place, e.g. a grassy field, a long hallway, a quadrant in outer space. I plan to support localization for English and Spanish, as well as visually impaired gamers (and I already have the backbone for each of these set up!). This project, if completed, will improve your resume due to its localization support and accessibility.

To bring the classic text-based game experience to modern audiences, I hope to make use of a large amount of auditory feedback. That is, I hope to have voice-overs, sound effects, and background music where appropriate. The way I have set up the story for this game is ideal because the largest amount of voice-over comes from ECO, the artificial intelligence. This means that we can simply record Microsoft Sam or Susie speaking (or we can use a screen reader to dynamically say ECO's lines).

Time-dependent sequences could be used to introduce a sense of urgency or excitement to the game. I'm imagining a sound similar to the tv series 24 could be used along side a visual/audible count down. The player would need to give their next command before the countdown ends. To introduce the concept the first time-dependent sequence could have a long countdown.

The hardest part in making this game will probably be the natural language processing involved (here is a class you can take for free to learn more or just Google around). Anytime the player types in or speaks a command, we have to be able to find the usable nouns and verbs and generate the appropriate response. So, typing or saying "go left" will make the character do that in game, if possible.
